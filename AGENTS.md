# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This repository is a BSP workspace that aggregates the main source trees as Git submodules. Keep the repository root focused on workspace metadata, documentation, and submodule entries.

- `buildroot/` for the Buildroot source tree
- `br2-external/` for board-specific Buildroot external configuration
- `linux/` for Linux kernel source trees, grouped by version such as `linux/linux-7.0/` and `linux/ti-linux-kernel-6.18.13/`
- `uboot/` for U-Boot source trees, grouped by version such as `uboot/uboot-2024.10/` and `uboot/ti-u-boot-2025.10/`
- `paf/` for PAF peripheral access framework code
- `docs/<board>/` for board-specific reference manuals, datasheets, schematics, and related documents

Do not mix generated build outputs into the repository root. Put new root-level documentation in `README.md`; put board-specific documents under `docs/<board>/` unless a tool requires a specific file at the root.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
No build system or test runner is configured yet. Until one is added, use standard Git commands for local workflow:

- `git status` to inspect changes
- `git diff` to review edits before commit
- `git add <path>` to stage specific files
- `git commit -m "type: short summary"` to create a commit

When build or test tooling is introduced, document the canonical commands here and keep them reproducible from the repository root.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Use 4-space indentation for new text-based source files unless the chosen language has a stronger community standard. Prefer ASCII-only content unless non-ASCII is required.

Naming guidance:

- Directories: lowercase, hyphenated when needed
- Files: descriptive and consistent with the language ecosystem
- Classes/types: `PascalCase`
- Functions/variables: `camelCase` or `snake_case`, matching the language

Add formatting or lint configuration with the first language/toolchain added to the repo.

## Testing Guidelines
Place tests under `tests/` and mirror the source layout where practical. Name tests after the unit under test, such as `tests/parser_test.*` or `tests/test_parser.*`, depending on the framework.

Every new feature or bug fix should include automated tests once a test framework exists.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
There is no existing commit history yet, so establish a simple convention now: `type: imperative summary` (for example, `docs: add contributor guide`).

Pull requests should include a short description, the reason for the change, and notes about validation performed. If the change affects user-visible behavior, include example output or screenshots where relevant.
